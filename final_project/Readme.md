## Instructions

When you go to the main page https://c5119ec1.ngrok.io/ or http://localhost:5000/, you are able to sign up or login. There are two different login methods: either via the **Travelz Journal** or via **Facebook**.

After logging in, you will get redirected your **Private Page** where you can see all your personal journals. 

In order to create a new journal, click on **Add a journal**. You need to enter **the name of your journal** and the **city**.

Once created, you will be redirected to **Journal Details**. In this page you can see the specific information about your trip. 

Inside Journal Details, you will add the **places** that you wish to visit in the city. You can also add any **comment** about each touristic spot. Use **Google Maps** to search for the places in the city you will be visiting.

While you're exploring the city, you can use **Travelz Journal** to mark the places you've already seen and hence organise your itinerary. To do so, simply mark the checkbox **Visited**.

Your journal information will be saved in our **database** so every time you go back to Travelz, you can see past journals, **delete** them and **create** new ones.
