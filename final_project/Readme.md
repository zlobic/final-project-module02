In order to create a new journal, click on **Add a journal**. You need to enter **the name of your journal** and the **city**

Once created, you will be redirected to **Journal Details**. In this page you can see the specific information about your trip. 

Inside Journal Details, you will add the **places** that you wish to visit in the city. You can also add any **comment** about each touristic spot. Use **Google Maps** to search for the places in the city you will be visiting.
